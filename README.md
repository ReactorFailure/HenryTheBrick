# Brick Discord App
A random Discord app that uses Google's Gemini API. I'll probably add random stuff to it later (maybe).

## How to run locally

- git clone the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ReactorFailure/HenryTheBrick.git
```

- download necessary dependencies **(make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed ðŸ¤¢)**:
```shell
npm install
```

- deploy slash commands:
```shell
node deploy.js
```

- run the app:
```shell
node .
```

## Dev branch
The dev branch is where I test things before pushing it to the `master` branch.
